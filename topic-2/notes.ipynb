    "The CEA is a supervised technique for learning concepts from data.\n",

    "There may be multiple hypotheses that fully capture positive elements in our data, but we want hypotheses which are consistent with the negative ones.\n",

    "All the functions consistent with positive and negative objects (meaning they classify them correctly) constitute the version space of the target concept.\n",

    "The ordering the CEA uses is induced by the relation \"more general than or equally general as\" ($ \\geq $).\n",

    "\n",
    "**Initialization**\n",
    "\n",
    "CEA initializes $ G $ to $ G_0 = \\{\\langle ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?\\rangle\\} $ and $ S $ to $ S_0 = \\{ \\langle \\bot, \\bot, \\bot, \\bot, \\bot, \\bot \\rangle\\} $.\n",
    "The space bounded by $ S_0 $ and $ G_0, V(G_0, S_0) $ is the whole hypothesis space $ H $.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Processing the first positive object**\n",
    "\n",
    "The only hypothesis in $ G $ is $ \\langle ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ? \\rangle $. \n",
    "This is consistent with the first object $ \\langle Sunny, Warm, Normal, Strong, Warm, Same \\rangle $, so $ G_1 = G_0 $ stays the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, $ \\langle \\bot, \\bot, \\bot, \\bot, \\bot, \\bot \\rangle $ as the only hypothesis in $ S $ is not\n",
    "consistent with the object, so we remove it.\n",
    "The minimal generalization of $ \\langle \\bot, \\bot, \\bot, \\bot, \\bot, \\bot \\rangle $ that still covers the object $ \\langle Sunny, Warm, Normal, Strong, Warm, Same \\rangle $ is precisely the hypothesis $ \\langle Sunny, Warm, Normal, Strong, Warm, Same \\rangle $. \n",
    "It is also less general than the hypothesis in $ G_1 $, so the new specific boundary is now\n",
    "$ S_1 = \\{\\langle Sunny, Warm, Normal, Strong, Warm, Same \\rangle\\}. $\n",
    "\n",
    "**Processing the second positive object**\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, the hypothesis in $ G $ is consistent with the positive example $ \\langle Sunny, Warm, High, Strong, Warm, Same \\rangle $, so no changes to the general boundary are necessary. $ G_2 = G_1 $\n",
    "\n",
    "The hypothesis $ \\langle Sunny, Warm, Normal, Strong, Warm, Same \\rangle $ from $ S_1 $ is overly\n",
    "specific, so we remove it from the boundary. \n",
    "Its minimal generalization that covers the second positive object is $ \\langle Sunny, Warm, ?, Strong, Warm, Same \\rangle $ which is less general than $ \\langle \\bot, \\bot, \\bot, \\bot, \\bot, \\bot \\rangle $ from $ G_2 $, so $ S_2 = \\{\\langle Sunny, Warm, ?, Strong, Warm, Same \\rangle\\} $.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Processing the first negative object**\n",
    "\n",
    "The third example is negative, so we enter the `else`-block within the main loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $ S_2 $ is consistent with the example $ \\langle Rainy, Cold, High, Strong, Warm, Change \\rangle $, we don't change it such that $ S_3 = S_2 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that $ \\langle ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ? \\rangle $ is too general and remove it from the boundary.\n",
    "Next, we can see that there are six minimal specializations of the removed hypothesis that are consistent with the example:\n",
    "$ \\langle Sunny, ?, ?, ?, ?, ? \\rangle, \\langle ?, Warm, ?, ?, ?, ? \\rangle, \\langle ?, ?, Normal, ?, ?, ? \\rangle, \\langle ?, ?, ?, Weak, ?, ? \\rangle, \\langle, ?, ?, ?, ?, Cold, ? \\rangle, \\langle ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, Same \\rangle $\n",
    "\n",
    "> To specialize a hypothesis so that it correctly classifies a negative object, we replace each ? in the hypothesis with values other than the one in the object.\n",
    "So, we have $ Sunny $ instead of $ Rainy $, $ Warm $ instead of $ Cold $ and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, only $ \\langle Sunny, ?, ?, ?, ?, ? \\rangle $, $ \\langle ?, Warm, ?, ?, ?, ? \\rangle $ and $ \\langle ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, Same \\rangle $ are more general than the hypothesis $ \\langle Sunny, Warm, ?, Strong, Warm, Same \\rangle $ we have in $ S_3 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "A hypothesis that isn't more general than *at least one* hypothesis in the specific boundary doesn't classify all the positive examples as positive. That's why we keep only the minimal specializations that are $ \\geq $ than the hypothesis in $ S_3 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Processing the third positive object**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the hypothesis $ \\langle ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, Same \\rangle $ is inconsistent with the object $ \\langle Sunny, Warm, High, Strong, Cool, Change \\rangle $, we remove it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The object $ \\langle Sunny, Warm, High, Strong, Cool, Change \\rangle $ shows that $ S_3 $ is overly specific, so we generalize the hypothesis to $ \\langle Sunny, Warm, ?, Strong, ?, ? $ and we get a new boundary $ S_4 $.\n",

    "\n",
    "> The policy by which  a [learning] algorithm generalizes from observed training examples to classify unseen instances is its inductive bias.\n",

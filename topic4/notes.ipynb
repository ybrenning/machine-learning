    "**Definition 1**\n",
    "A random experiment or a random trial is a procedure that, at least theoretically, can be repeated infinite times. It is characterized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Configuration (A precisely specified system that can be reconstructed)\n",
    "2. Procedure (An instruction on how to execute the experiment, based on the config)\n",
    "3. Unpredictability of the outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "A set $ \\Omega = \\{\\omega_1, \\omega_2, \\dots, \\omega_n\\} $ is called *sample space* of a random experiment, if eac hexperiment outcome is associated with at most one element $ \\omega \\in \\Omega $. The elements in $ \\Omega $ are called *outcomes*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $ \\Omega $ be a finite sample space. Each subset $ A \\subseteq \\Omega $ is called an event, which occurs iff the experiment outcome $ \\omega $ is a member of $ A $. The set of all events $ \\mathcal{P}(\\Omega) $, is called the event space or $ \\sigma $-algebra.\n",

    "* Experiment: Rolling a dice\n",

    "* Some Event: $ A = \\{2, 4, 6\\} $\n",

    "* Experiment: Rolling two dice at the same time\n",
    "* Sample Space: $ \\Omega = \\{\\{1, 1\\}, \\{1, 2\\}, \\dots, \\{6, 6\\}\\} $\n",
    "* Some Event: $ B = \\{\\{1, 2\\}\\} $\n",

    "4. Subjectivist, Bayesian, prognostic\n",

    "**Classical/Laplace Probability**\n",
    "\n",
    "If each elementary event $ \\{\\omega\\}, \\omega \\in \\Omega $ gets assigned the same probability, then the probability $ P(A) $ of an event $ A $ is defined as follows:\n",

    "$ P(A) = \\frac{|A|}{|\\Omega|} $\n",

    "\n",
    "Basis is the **empirical law of large numbers**:\n",
    "\n",
    "In a random experiment, the average of the outcomes obtained from a large number of trials is close to the expected value, it will come closer as more trials are performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Axiomatic**\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Postulate a function $ P() $ (That assigns a probability to every event in $ \\mathcal{P}(\\Omega) $)\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Specify the required properties (of $ P() $ in the form of axioms)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Subjectivist, Bayesian, Prognostic**\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider (prior) knowledge about the hypotheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ p(h \\mid D) = \\frac{p(D \\mid h) \\cdot p(h)}{p(D)} $\n",

    "### Axiomatic Approach to Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "**Probability Measure**\n",
    "Let $ \\Omega $ be a set, called sample space, and let $ \\mathcal{\\Omega} $ be an event space. A Function $ P, P: \\mathcal{P}(\\Omega) \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R} $, which maps each event $ A $ onto a a real number $ P(A) $ is called probability measure if it has the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $ P(A) \\geq 0 $ (Axiom I)\n",
    "2. $ P(\\Omega) = 1 $ (Axiom II)\n",
    "3. $ A \\cap B = \\emptyset \\Rightarrow P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) $ (Axiom III)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Probability Space**\n",
    "Let $ \\Omega $ be a sample space, $ \\mathcal{P}(\\Omega) $ be an event space, and $ P: \\mathcal{P}(\\Omega) \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R} $ be a probability measure. Then the tuple $ (\\Omega, P) $ as well as the tripe $ (\\Omega, \\mathcal{P}(\\Omega), P) $ is called probability space.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kolmogorov Axioms also imply:\n",
    "1. $ P(A) + (P(\\overline{A}) = 1 $\n",
    "2. $ P(\\emptyset) = 0 $\n",
    "3. $ A \\subseteq B \\Rightarrow P(A) \\leq P(B) $\n",
    "4. $ P(A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \\cap B) $\n",
    "5. Let $ A_1, A_2, \\dots A_n $ be mutually exclusive (incompatible), then holds:\n",
    "   - $ P(A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup \\dots \\cup A_n) = P(A_1) + P(A_2) + \\dots + P(A_n) $\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conditional Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $ (\\Omega, \\mathcal{P}(\\Omega), P) $ be a probability space and let $ A, B \\in \\mathcal{P}(\\Omega) $ be two events. Then the probability of the occurence of event $ A $ given that event $ B $ is known to have occurred is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ P(A \\mid B) = \\frac{P(A \\cup B)}{P(B)} $ if $ P(B) > 0 $\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called \"probability of A under condition B\".\n",
    "\n",
    "![img1](img/topic4img1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Total Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $ (\\Omega, \\mathcal{P}(\\Omega), P) $ be a probability space and let $ A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_n $ be mutually exclusive events with $ \\Omega = A_1 \\cup \\dots \\cup A_n, P(A_i) > 0, i = 1, \\dots, n $. Then for each $ B \\in \\mathcal{P}(\\Omega) $ holds:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ P(B) = \\sum\\limits_{i = 1}{k} P(A_i) \\cdot P(B \\mid A_i) $\n",
    "\n",
    "![img2](img/topic4img2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Independence of Events\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $ (\\Omega, \\mathcal{P}(\\Omega), P) $ be a probability space and let $ A, B \\in \\mathcal{P}(\\Omega) $ be two events. Then $ A $ and $ B $ are called statistically independet iff the following holds true:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ P(A \\cap B) = P(A) \\cdot P(B) $ (multiplication rule)\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\Rightarrow P(A \\mid B) = P(A \\mid \\overline{B}) $\n",
    "$ \\Leftrightarrow P(A \\mid B) = P(A) $\n",
    "\n",
    "The statistical independence of $ k $ events can also be determined by checking whether the multiplication rule holds true for all subsets of the $ k $ events."
